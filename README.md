# Generating Sheet Music
The goal of this project is to explore and evaluate ways of generating sheet music images. We do this by training two language models, AWD-LSTM and GPT-2, 
and by using 5 different approaches: pixel columns, image patches (pixel blocks), visual word tokens, semantic encoding, and XML/MEI code. 

The paper for this project was accepted to ISMIR '22.
